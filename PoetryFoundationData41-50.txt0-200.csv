The Wise Men will unlearn your name.
Above your head no star will flame.
One weary sound will be the same—
the hoarse roar of the gale.
The shadows fall from your tired eyes
as your lone bedside candle dies,
for here the calendar breeds nights
till stores of candles fail.
What prompts this melancholy key?
A long familiar melody.
It sounds again. So let it be.
Let it sound from this night.
Let it sound in my hour of  death—
as gratefulness of eyes and lips
for that which sometimes makes us lift
our gaze to the far sky.
You glare in silence at the wall.
Your stocking gapes: no gifts at all.
It's clear that you are now too old
to trust in good Saint Nick;
that it's too late for miracles.
—But suddenly, lifting your eyes
to heaven's light, you realize:
your life is a sheer gift.

We'd  like  to  talk  with  you  about  fear they  said  so
many  people  live  in  fear  these  days  they  drove  up
all  four  of  them  in  a  small  car nice   boy  they  said
beautiful  dogs they  said  so  friendly  the  man  ahead
of  the  woman  the other  two  waiting  in  the  drive  I
was  outside digging up the garden no one home I said
what   are  you  selling   anyway  I'm   not  interested  I
said  well  you  have  a  nice  day  they  said  here's  our
card  there's   a  phone  number  you  can  call  anytime
any  other   houses  down  this  road  anyone  else   live
here  we'd  like  to  talk  to  them  about  living  in  fear

          Philosophic
in its complex, ovoid emptiness,
a skillful pundit coined it as a sort
    of stopgap doorstop for those
           quaint equations           Romans never
dreamt of. In form completely clever
and discrete—a mirror come unsilvered,     loose watch face without the works,              a hollowed globe            from tip to toe
unbroken, it evades the grappling
hooks of mass, tilts the thin rim of no thing,     remains embryonic sum,             non-cogito.

Dear Writers, I’m compiling the first in what I hope is a series of publications I’m calling artists among artists. The theme for issue 1 is “Faggot Dinosaur.” I hope to hear from you! Thank you and best wishes.                                                                                          —Ali, editor, Artists among Artists
I think that I shall never fear
a brontosaurus that is queer,
iguanodon as fetisheer,
a mammoth bringing up the rear,
an astrodon with extra gear,
metrosexual squirrel and deer,
a breeder with a dance career,
a fruit with cauliflower ear,
a lesbianic Chanticleer,
a grinning limpish-wristed Lear,
the weird one or the mutineer,
but those who perfectly adhere,
stay clear, stay clear, stay clear, stay clear.
